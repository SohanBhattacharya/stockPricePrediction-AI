# stockPricePrediction-AI  
An AI-powered financial dashboard that blends real-time stock data, market sentiment, and visualization for smarter investing insights.

## Overview  
stockPricePrediction-AI is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that brings together live stock data, news sentiment analysis and rich visualizations to help users explore and interpret market dynamics.  
At its core the system:  
- Fetches **real-time stock price** and volume data from yfinance.  
- Retrieves recent financial news headlines, computes **sentiment scores** (via TextBlob and optionally HuggingFace Hub models).  
- Presents interactive charts (line/candlestick) using Plotly and metric cards & controls via Streamlit.  
- Combines these inputs into a dashboard that gives users insights into *what the market is doing* + *how sentiment might be influencing it*.

## Key Features  
- ✅ Live Stock Data – Real-time price trends, historical time-series, and volume metrics.  
- ✅ Sentiment Analysis – News scraping + text analysis give a snapshot of investor sentiment.  
- ✅ Interactive Visuals – Charts, dashboards, and metrics allow exploration and drilling down.  
- ✅ Modular Codebase – Clear separation of concerns (data fetch, NLP, UI).  
- ✅ Configurable – Uses environment variables for API/tokens, making it secure and flexible.

## Architecture & Code Structure  
Below is a discussion of the software’s architecture and how the code is factored:

### Architectural Overview  
1. **User Interface (UI layer)**  
   - `mainPage.py` serves as the entry point. It drives the Streamlit app: user inputs (ticker symbol, date range), triggers backend modules and renders charts and metrics.  
   - The UI layer handles user control flow, layout, and visualization.  
2. **Data Fetching Layer**  
   - `priceFetch.py` is responsible for pulling stock data (via yfinance) and organizing it into a usable DataFrame.  
   - It abstracts away details of API calls and time-series handling, so the UI doesn’t need to know the exact fetching logic.  
3. **News / NLP Layer**  
   - `nlp.py` handles the retrieval of news headlines (via web scraping or APIs) and computes sentiment. The logic includes cleaning, tokenizing, applying TextBlob polarity, and optionally using more advanced HuggingFace models.  
   - This module returns structured data (e.g., a DataFrame of headlines + scores) that the UI can visualise or summarise.  
4. **Helper / Utility Layer**  
   - `companyName.py` provides mappings between company names, ticker symbols, validations or look-ups. Keeps UI clean from requiring the user to remember exact ticker codes.  
   - `requirements.txt` lists dependencies so that the environment can be reproduced reliably.  
   - `.devcontainer/` (if present) sets up a development container for consistency across dev machines.  
5. **Configuration / Environment**  
   - The app uses `python-dotenv` to load credentials (e.g., HuggingFace tokens) or API keys from a `.env` file. This separates secret/config from code and eases deployment to different environments.  
6. **Visualization / Dashboard Logic**  
   - Inside `mainPage.py`, the UI retrieves data from the fetch and NLP modules, manipulates it (filtering, aggregating), then uses Plotly (e.g., line chart, candlestick chart) and Streamlit metric cards to present meaningful insights: stock trend + sentiment summary side by side.  
   - Example workflow: user selects ticker → priceFetch returns historical data → UI shows price chart → UI calls nlp module → presents sentiment summary (e.g., % positive vs negative) → optionally visualises the sentiment time trend.

### Code-Organization & Factoring  
Here is a suggested high-level folder/file structure (the repository already uses a flat script layout; you might reorganize as you grow):

````

stockpriceprediction-ai/
├── .devcontainer/
│     └── … (dev container config)
├── src/
│   ├── **init**.py
│   ├── price_fetch.py         # priceFetch.py refactored
│   ├── news_nlp.py            # nlp.py refactored
│   ├── ticker_utils.py        # companyName.py refactored
│   └── dashboard.py           # UI logic extracted from mainPage.py

│   └── test_news_nlp.py
├── main.py                    # entry point for the app (calls dashboard)
├── requirements.txt
├── .env.example
└── README.md


````

**Factoring rationale:**
- `src/` folder is the Python package containing core logic, making it easier to import, test, and maintain.  
- Splitting UI logic (`dashboard.py`) from data logic (`price_fetch.py`, `news_nlp.py`) and utility logic (`ticker_utils.py`) ensures each module has a clear responsibility.  
- `tests/` folder allows unit/integration tests without mixing with production code.  
- `main.py` is the lightweight launcher: `streamlit run main.py`, within which you import `dashboard` and show the UI.  
- `.env.example` illustrates required environment variables (e.g., `HF_TOKEN_ONE`, `HF_TOKEN_TWO`) and encourages secure management.

### Data & Flow Summary  
1. **User selects** a stock ticker via UI.  
2. UI invokes **price fetch** module, retrieving historical and/or real-time stock data.  
3. UI invokes **news/NLP** module, retrieving recent news headlines and computing sentiment.  
4. UI processes both data sets (e.g., align times, aggregate sentiment per day).  
5. UI renders:  
   - A **price chart** (line or candlestick) showing recent movement.  
   - A **sentiment summary** showing percentage of positive vs negative headlines, or sentiment trend over time.  
   - Possibly a combined view (e.g., sentiment vs price change).  
6. UI may allow **time-range selection**, **ticker change**, **update/refresh**, and **download/export** (if implemented) of results.

### Extensibility Considerations  
- **Predictive modelling**: Future enhancements might include training and applying an LSTM or Prophet model to forecast future prices. That logic would likely go into a new module (e.g., `prediction_model.py`).  
- **Caching & performance**: For frequent users, caching results (price fetch, news download) can reduce API load / increase responsiveness. You might use `@st.cache_data` or `functools.lru_cache`.  
- **Error handling**: Network/API failures should gracefully degrade (e.g., show “No data available” instead of crash).  
- **Deployment considerations**: Dockerfile, CI/CD, GitHub Actions, and external deployment (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, AWS) can make the app production-ready.  
- **Multiple tickers / portfolio view**: The architecture easily extends to multiple tickers, enabling portfolio analytics and comparative sentiment.


## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SohanBhattacharya/stockPricePrediction-AI.git  
   cd stockPricePrediction-AI  


2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file at the project root and define environmental variables, for example:

   ```bash
   HF_TOKEN_ONE=your_huggingface_token_1  
   HF_TOKEN_TWO=your_huggingface_token_2  
   ```

   (Replace tokens with your credentials as needed.)
4. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run mainPage.py  
   ```

## Usage & Examples

* Upon launching the app, select a stock ticker symbol (for example, `AAPL`).
* The dashboard will display the stock’s recent price history and volume.
* You’ll also see a sentiment summary from recent news headlines—how many were positive vs negative, and how sentiment changed over time.
* Charts (line/candlestick) are interactive—hover to see values, zoom into date ranges.
* Use the UI controls to change time ranges, tickers, or update the data.

## Future Enhancements

* ✨ Add **predictive models** (e.g., LSTM, Prophet, regression) to forecast future stock prices.
* ✨ Enable **portfolio tracking** & backtesting (multiple tickers, aggregate performance).
* ✨ Expand **news sentiment analysis** across multiple tickers, multiple languages, or more sources.
* ✨ Add **download/export** functionality (CSV, PDF report) and **alerting** (email/push notifications on large sentiment shifts).
* ✨ Add **Docker**/CI for deployment, and refine caching/performance for production.
